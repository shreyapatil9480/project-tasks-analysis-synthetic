# Synthetic Project Tasks Analysis

This repository contains a **synthetic dataset** simulating project management tasks, along with a Jupyter notebook demonstrating exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and predictive modeling. It is designed to showcase analytical skills relevant to roles such as **Business Analyst**, **Program Manager**, and **Data Analyst**.

## Dataset

The dataset `synthetic_project_tasks.csv` includes 300 synthetic records of project tasks, with the following columns:

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ProjectID` | Identifier for each project (e.g., `Project_1`, `Project_2`). |
| `TaskID` | Unique identifier for each task (e.g., `T0001`). |
| `TaskName` | Short task description (e.g., *Strategic Planning*). |
| `AssignedTo` | Team member responsible for the task. |
| `StartDate` | Task start date. |
| `EndDate` | Task end date. |
| `DurationDays` | Duration of the task in days. |
| `Budget` | Allocated budget for the task (USD). |
| `ActualCost` | Actual cost incurred (USD). |
| `TaskStatus` | Current status (`Not Started`, `In Progress`, `Completed`, `Cancelled`, `On Hold`). |
| `Priority` | Priority level (`Low`, `Medium`, `High`, `Critical`). |
| `CompletionPercentage` | Percent completion (0â€“100). |
| `OverBudget` | Indicator whether actual cost exceeded the budget (`1`=Yes, `0`=No). |

All data is **synthetic** and generated for demonstration purposes only.

## Notebook

The Jupyter notebook `analysis.ipynb` demonstrates:

- Loading and exploring the dataset.
- Computing summary statistics and visualizing distributions (e.g., budgets, costs, task status counts).
- Creating scatter plots to examine relationships between budget and actual cost.
- Preprocessing categorical variables and building a logistic regression model to predict whether a task will go over budget (`OverBudget`).
- Evaluating the model using a confusion matrix and classification report.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>
```

2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Open the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook analysis.ipynb
```

4. Run the notebook cells to explore the dataset and reproduce the analysis. Feel free to modify the code to explore further insights or experiment with different models.
